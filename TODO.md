# Project To-do List

- [ ] Determine how much of the data I can use to predict things about future races. (aka set MIN_YEAR)
    - [ ] Clean the data such that only what I need is in each dataset
- [ ] Figure out the problem statements. What am I going to predict through regression/classification?
    - Look at all the data determine which features I need from which files
    - Determine if I can create a single dataframe in order to predict what I need to
- [ ] Do the EDA
    - [ ] Review EDA
    - [ ] Create correlation matrices
    - [ ] Create pairplots
    - [ ] Determine which features to use for each problem statement
- [ ] Create the models
    - [ ] Build a model, then implement the testing of that model. (one at a time)
- [ ] Put all predictions in the get_results.py and make it pretty
